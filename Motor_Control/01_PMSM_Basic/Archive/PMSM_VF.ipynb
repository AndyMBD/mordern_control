    "V/f control is a method to control a ratio between primary voltage (V) to be applied to the induction motor and inverter output frequency (f) to be constant. <br>\n",
    "This control enables to obtain satisfactory torque characteristics in a wide frequency range by maintaining the magnitude of the rotating magnetic field vector ***independently*** from the inverter output frequency a when voltage drop due to a primary winding resistance is ignored.<br>\n",
    "However, as the frequency declines, the voltage drop due to the primary winding resistance becomes too large to be ignored, and consequently it becomes impossible to obtain sufficient torque.<br> \n",
    "In such a case, applying a higher voltage than the voltage calculated from the V/f ratio which was used for a high frequency makes it possible to secure enough torque even at a low frequency."
