Welcome to Fundamentals of Linear Systems
=====================================

This book is intended to support an introductory engineenring course on linear systems  
  
The material is not specific to a particular field of engineering  
and draws examples from various analogous systems  
In this way the course is intended for a general engineering audience at the sophomore level  
  
Prerequisite knowledge of Calculus I and Physics I are required for the course  
  
Those readers who are familiar with the topic will find some topics are not covered completely  
and they may feel the knowledge is misleading or in error  
Please consider the material is difficult to understand and hiding the entire picture from a student,  
new to this material can be beneficial for their understanding  
  
If you are new to the material, please be patient, the entire picture will ultimately be unveiled
